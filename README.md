# VLC-SRCOM
VLC results from SRCOM for Activity Recognition
Files from the paper "Indoor monitoring system based on ARQ signaling generated by a Visible Light Communication link", Authors: Joan Bas, Jose Antonio Ortega, Mart√≠ Busquets and Alexis Dowhuszko. 
Presented at Globlecom 2021, Madrid, Spain, 7-11 December 
Measurements of the time to ARQ for different activities that block the optical links in a temporal way. According to the shape, duration, etc. it is possible to use them
for developing activity recognition systems based on AI or hybrid RF/Optical systems
